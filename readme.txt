Our assignment implementation is a Cinema Booking System, where the user can search by either movie or cinema. The user starts by selecting Search by Cinema or Search by Movie on the initial screen. Once a Movie or Cinema is selected, the user will be presented with a detail view corresponding to which cinema or movie they selected. From this screen, the user can book up to 10 tickets for a given session.

Known bugs: None
